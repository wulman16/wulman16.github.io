    Iâ€™m a software engineer based in Atlanta, GA with a background in art
    history. Most recently I was a UI/UX engineer at AXYYS, Inc., where I built
    security middleware to evaluate and quarantine malicious client-side code.
    Prior to my time at AXYYS, I helped develop a digital preservation
    repository as part of a team at Emory University Libraries, using and
    contributing to open-source engines from the Samvera and Blacklight
    communities.

    My experience designing and developing programs has opened up for me a
    variety of novel technical problems that can't be approached through
    humanistic inquiry alone. I try to leverage my programming skills, enriched
    by my arts background, to craft thoughtful and elegant solutions to those
    problems.

    Before my career in engineering, I received a BA in Art History from the
    University of Chicago and undertook PhD coursework at Emory. After
    contributing research to a number of digital humanities projects during my
    graduate studies, I became fascinated by the technological sides of those
    projects, and I decided to change careers in order to channel my creative
    energies through code.
