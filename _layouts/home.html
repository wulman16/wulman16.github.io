    Iâ€™m a software engineer at Emory University with a background in art
    history. I'm currently building a digital preservation repository as part of
    a team at Emory Libraries, using and contributing to open-source engines
    from the Samvera and Blacklight communities. My experience designing and
    developing programs has opened up for me a variety of novel technical
    problems that can't be approached through humanistic inquiry alone. I try to
    leverage my programming skills, enriched by my arts background, to craft
    thoughtful and elegant solutions to those problems.

    Before coming to Emory Libraries, I received a BA from the University of
    Chicago in 2016 and undertook PhD coursework at Emory. After contributing
    research to a number of digital humanities projects during my graduate
    studies, I became fascinated by the technological sides of those projects,
    and I decided to change careers in order to channel my creative energies
    through code.
